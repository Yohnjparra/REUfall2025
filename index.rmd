# Program Overview {.tabset}

**Program Duration:** September 29 - December 6, 2025

This document outlines the weekly milestones for our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Computational Data Science program. Our cohort includes students working on two primary research tracks:

- **Group 1 (Computer Vision):** Marcus Jones, Sydney Johnson, Massai Morgan - Food Classification Application
- **Group 2 (NLP):** Seth Thomas, Breosha young - EU Taxonomy Question Answering System


Welcome to our Research Experience for Undergraduates CDS (Computational Data Science) program! Below you'll find our talented cohort of undergraduate researchers, their academic backgrounds, and the exciting research projects they're working on this Fall 2025.


### Student Profiles

#### Marcus Jones

![Marcus Jones](images/marcus.jpeg){width="150px" height="150px" style="border-radius: 50%; float: left; margin-right: 20px; object-fit: cover; object-position: 50% 20%;"}

**Major:** Computer Science 
**Year:** Senior  

**Research Interest:** Deep Learning Applications in Culinary Context (Group 1)

Marcus will develop a computer vision application that classifies a photographed food item and returns the predicted label with an associated confidence score. This tool supports reliable, on-device food recognition.

**Major:** Computer Science 
**Year:** Junior  

**Research Interest:** Question Answering with Deep Learning  (Group 2)

Thomas will develop an intelligent question-answering application that processes the European Union (EU) Taxonomy for sustainable activities to respond to user queries on sustainable finance. The system will extract and structure regulatory concepts from the EU Taxonomy, enabling automated, evidence-based answers to finance and sustainability questions.
